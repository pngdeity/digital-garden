Tmux is a terminal multiplexer.

Tmux creates sessions
And sessions are composed of windows
And windows are composed of panes (these each get a pseudo-terminal)

all of which may take up some of your screen

For a live tmux environment,
start it up with a simple tmux command. 
Without any arguments, it should create a new session.
If there is an already runnning tmux session (as evidenced by a socket file
in /tmp), you can attach to that session using tmux attach. TBD how to attach
to a predefined session as defined in the tmux config file, whether
/etc/tmux.conf or ~/.tmux.conf

Some pertinent live tmux commands:
NOTE: These are defaults and I have no reason to believe they are or are not
sane defaults.

The control key combo (aka prefix keys) is ctrl-b (either ctrl has been tested and confirmed to work)

For windows indexing, the indexes need not start at zero, and they need not be
contiguous. 

Keep in mind this: if you intend to use tmux as a replacement for i3 as you
currently use it, your feature set must be very small.
i3 to tmux translation table:
Move a window to another workspace
Go to another workspace
Switch the focus between programs within the same workspace

i3 operation				tmux operation
Full screen (one-way)		!	Pop-out current pane into new window
Move window to new workspace	.	Prompt for index to move current
window
Restart X server		r	Force redraw of attached client

What's with the status bar?
[session name] 1:window-name-index-one 3:active-window* 4:window-index-four

Create a new workspace 

Moving around:
0 through 9	Select the window indexed one through nine, given it already
exists
;		Move to the previously selected pane
.		Prompt for a destination index to move the current window
o		Select the next pane in the current window

Life and death:
%		Split the current pane in twain, left and right
"		Split the current pane in twain, top and bottom
x		Kill the current pane
&		Kill the current window (easier than typing exit)
